    description: The purpose of this project was to develop an automated linux monitoring agent. The agent extracts various pieces of information in the user's system including but not limited to, the number of CPUs, CPU architecture, system speed in MHz, and so on. Our objective was to create two bash file scripts, one for host information adn another for host usage. The host info bash file retreives hardware specifications of the user's system, and the host usage bash file retreives the user's system's usage specifications. We then created a PostgreSQL database, in which we inserted all of the corresponding specifications into. We then verified the accuracy of the data by running a select statement in our PSQL database to verify the correct data were being show. This was done completely on a Docker container which created our database, in place of a Virtual Machine, since Docker is a lot more light-weight than a typical VM.
